# Community Review

The Da Weapons list is starting to feel its age.  The goal of this folder is to create a more readable list that is more easily read for human review.

I hope that we as a community can use this list to come together on some updates and provide a standard for all stat sites, bots, etc to use moving forward.

Please make pull requests on this list and we can merge the final results back into a more optimized list later.

There's a script to resort the human list and compile it into the machine list:
* npm run resort
* npm run compile
